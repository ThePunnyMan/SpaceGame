			<p><b><u>Progress:</u></b></p>
			<li>October 7, 2018 -This week more progress was made on the player character. One of our plans was to create sections in space that utilized weapon momentum. We added a friction coefficient
				which increases the amount of time for the player to stop moving. In addition, it lowers the influence of the players movement controls. The weapon recoil is not affected by this which
				allows the player to move by firing in the opposite direction.<br>

				We also added a second weapon type. The shotgun fires three projectiles. One directly ahead and one on either side at a 10 degree angle. The shotgun fires slower and has a larger recoil
				than the pistol.We also added the ability to switch between the pistol and shotgun using the space bar.<br>

				Finally, we added some controller support. This has been tested with a wired xbox 360 controller The player is moved using the left analogue stick. When the player tilts the right analogue
				stick, the player character fires in the direction that the stick was tilted in. Currently, weapons can be switched using the a button. When controller input is detected, the mouse cursor
				becomes hidden. Moving with the arrow keys or clicking the mouse button brings it back.

			<li>September 29, 2018 - This week we acquired some free assets to work as the current wall and floor sprites. We used Unityâ€™s Tilemap feature to quickly prototype different level layouts 
				by using the Tilemap brushes. This allowed us to easily add collision detections to the walls as well. We will next begin work on creating other types of objects to be placed in our levels. 
				Weapon upgrades will likely be implemented next.<br>

			<li>September 22, 2018 - We created a unity project and activated the collaboration option so all group members could work together. We created a prototype to test basic player controls.
			    The "player character" can move with wasd and a cursor is generated to show where the player is aiming. The player can shoot by pressing the mouse button or holding the button down.
			    A restriction has been placed on the weapons fire rate. There still isnt any collision detection.<br>
