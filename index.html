		<h4 align = 'center'>This website is to provide updates on group 7's progress on their upcoming game. Updates are posted each saturday about the progress made during the week</h4>
		<ul>
			<p><b><u>Progress:</u></b></p>
			<li>September 29, 2018 - This week we acquired some free assets to work as the current wall and floor sprites. We used Unityâ€™s Tilemap feature to quickly prototype different level layouts 
				by using the Tilemap brushes. This allowed us to easily add collision detections to the walls as well. We will next begin work on creating other types of objects to be placed in our levels. 
				Weapon upgrades will likely be implemented next.<br>

			<li>September 22, 2018 - We created a unity project and activated the collaboration option so all group members could work together. We created a prototype to test basic player controls.
			    The "player character" can move with wasd and a cursor is generated to show where the player is aiming. The player can shoot by pressing the mouse button or holding the button down.
			    A restriction has been placed on the weapons fire rate. There still isnt any collision detection.<br>
