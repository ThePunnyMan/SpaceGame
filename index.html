  <p class="w3-large">Our game is a 2-D, top-down, puzzle/shooter game. In this game, you will play the role of a lone astronaut, whose space ship has come under siege by an alien force. You must now fight and solve your way through various, treacherous rooms on your way to the ship's escape pod. Be careful to watch your oxygen meter, as the threat of suffocation is as real as the gunshots. Will you find your way out of this tin-can maze, or will your last breath be lost in space...</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Final Presentation</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">This is the final week of this project. The final build of this game includes two weapon types, three common enemy types with a boss enemy and four levels. One of the issues we addressed
	      was the difficulty of the third room. We reduced the number of enemies spawned on the third wave to make it a little easier. In addition, we animated enemy spawn locations. There is a red glow whenever
	      the next wave of enemies spawns. That way, the player has more time to react to incoming enemies. Since the boss enemy did not have
	      any indication of its current health, two changes were made. First, the boss now becomes progressively more red the lower its health drops. Second, a health bar was added to the bottom of the screen.
	      In addition, the boss now has a simple animation it plays to indicate when it dies so the transition to the win screen isn't so jarring. The game now tracks how long a person's
	      runthrough lasts. Once the boss is defeated, the final time is displayed. The game keeps track of the top 10 completion times in a leaderboard. If a person's time is fast enough to be ranked, the game
	      asks for their name and stores it in the leaderboard which can be viewed from the main menu. </p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Preparing for Game Day</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Most of our work this week was devoted to tweaking different aspects of our game to get it ready for the final presentation. Some enemy types need to be tuned down to create a less challenging experience.
	    The mass of the bomb enemies was reduced in order to prevent them from trapping the player as well. With the bulk of the game already completed, our focus was on balancing and quality of life improvements to make for a better
	    experience for the player.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Game Demo Week</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">This week was the in class game demo. For this milestone, we promised to have two more levels, a total of three enemies and a boss enemy. On the day of the event we
      had all of things as well as multiple other smaller updates. In the first level, we updated the enemy's AI so it was more realistic and replaced the placeholder sprite with a new sprite
      created by us. The second level was updated by adding two patrolling enemies. The new third level is arena shaped. Three waves of enemies spawn in one at a time. In order to proceed, the player must
      defeat all three waves. This is the first room with the two new basic enemies. The first is a statue shaped enemy that persues the player, fires projectiles in all directions and then flees
      until it is time to attack again. The other is a bomb shaped enemy that persues the player for a certain amount of time until they explode. To keep players stocked with ammo, each enemy has a chance to drop an item that restores some amminution to all the player's weapons.<br> The final room has our boss enemy. This enemy
      has three phases. The first involves the tentacle slap attack and spinning attack mentioned last week. Each frame of animation has a box collider drawn around it for collision detection. 
      The boss saves the players position last frame and takes the difference to get a velocity prediciton. It then uses this value to predict where the player will be when the next attack starts.
      The second phase adds a new attack. The enemy spits a ball of slime and when it reaches the player's predicted location it creates an area that damages the enemy and slows their movement.
      The final phase is the same as the second phase but the cooldowns for the attacks are reduced. Beating the boss takes the player to a winning screen that displays how long it took to beat the game
      There is also a new game over screen if the player runs out of lives and a settings screen that allows the player to adjust the volume and toggle controller usage. All three of these screens are functional but are only placeholders and need some adjustment.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Completion of Enemy types</h5>
      <p class="w3-large"> This week we were working on 2 different enemies which includes an all directional shooting enemy in level 3 and a "Boss" enemy in level 4. We have completed the animation of 
      the boss enemy with 2 different types of attacks where one of the attack includes slapping the player from underground by approximately finding the location the player and other 
      attack is 
      slapping with tentacles when the player is near to a wall which reduces the the player's chances to hide from other enemies behind the walls. We have structured the levels in such
      a way that
      would help enemies with their specific attacking strategies eventually creating a sense of challenge for the player. We have also included sound effects for the weapon pickup, 
      shotgun reload, 
      piston shooting and a background music throughout the levels.

      <p class="w3-large">This week we created more artwork for the game. The artwork for two enemy types was completed, including animations. Each enemy has a standard idle animation, but the 
	    patrol enemy also has the alert and engaged states with their own animations. Transitioning between these animations will be done with the built in animation state machine in Unity.
	    We could not find assets online to suit our needs, so these are original works.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Preperation for the First Playable</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">This week we prepared for the <a href = 'FirstPlayable.pdf'>first playable presentation</a>. We created a starting menu with the options to play the game, change the settings and exit the game.
	    The settings option currently doesn't do anything. We prepared two levels for the player to move in. The first consisted of a room with an enemy and weapon drops. The second room had the layout for one of 
	    our puzzles; however we didn't finish implementing it in time for the presentation. We added health and weapon persistance to the game. When moving between rooms, the player's health, current weapons and ammo
	    count are consistant between levels. Projectiles now deal damage to the player and enemies. At the moment, the amount of damage is hard coded but we plan to change that in the near future. Once the player or
	    enemy run out of health, they despawn. We encountered some issues with the ai character not spotting the player which will need to be fixed. </p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Patrol Enemy Type</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">This week we implemented one of the main enemy types for the game. The enemy has a default "patrol" state in which it moves between set waypoints, waiting for a player to enter into its 
	    vision cone. The range and angle of the cone can be easily tweaked in the unity inspector to more quickly find what feels right for the game. Once the enemy detects a player, it "engages" the player character.
	    It takes shots when it has line of sight, and moves to the waypoint closest to where the player was last seen if it does not have a shot. If the player is out of sight for a long enough time, the enemy returns
	    to its default patrol state.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Player Weapons & Controls</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">This week more progress was made on the player character. One of our plans was to create sections in space that utilized weapon momentum. We added a friction coefficient
          which increases the amount of time for the player to stop moving. In addition, it lowers the influence of the players movement controls. The weapon recoil is not affected by this which
          allows the player to move by firing in the opposite direction.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Player Weapons & Controls (continued)</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">We also added a second weapon type. The shotgun fires three projectiles. One directly ahead and one on either side at a 10 degree angle. The shotgun fires slower and has a larger recoil
      than the pistol.We also added the ability to switch between the pistol and shotgun using the space bar.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Player Weapons & Controls (continued)</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Finally, we added some controller support. This has been tested with a wired xbox 360 controller The player is moved using the left analogue stick. When the player tilts the right analogue
      stick, the player character fires in the direction that the stick was tilted in. Currently, weapons can be switched using the a button. When controller input is detected, the mouse cursor
      becomes hidden. Moving with the arrow keys or clicking the mouse button brings it back.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Tiles & Map Building</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">This week we acquired some free assets to work as the current wall and floor sprites. We used Unity’s Tilemap feature to quickly prototype different level layouts by using the Tilemap brushes. This allowed us to easily add collision detections to the walls as well. We will next begin work on creating other types of objects to be placed in our levels. Weapon upgrades will likely be implemented next.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">We created a unity project and activated the collaboration option so all group members could work together. We created a prototype to test basic player controls. The "player character" can move with wasd and a cursor is generated to show where the player is aiming. The player can shoot by pressing the mouse button or holding the button down. A restriction has been placed on the weapons fire rate. There still isnt any collision detection.</p>
