			<p><b><u>Progress:</u></b></p>
			<li>September 22, 2018 - We created a unity project and activated the collaboration option so all group members could work together. We created a prototype to test basic player controls.
			    The "player character" can move with wasd and a cursor is generated to show where the player is aiming. The player can shoot by pressing the mouse button or holding the button down.
			    A restriction has been placed on the weapons fire rate. There still isnt any collision detection.
