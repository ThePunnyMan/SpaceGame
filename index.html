  <p class="w3-large">Our game is a 2-D, top-down, puzzle/shooter game. In this game, you will play the role of a lone astronaut, whose space ship has come under siege by an alien force. You must now fight and solve your way through various, treacherous rooms on your way to the ship's escape pod. Be careful to watch your oxygen meter, as the threat of suffocation is as real as the gunshots. Will you find your way out of this tin-can maze, or will your last breath be lost in space...</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Completion of Enemy types</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">This week we implemented one of the main enemy types for the game. The enemy has a default "patrol" state in which it moves between set waypoints, waiting for a player to enter into its 
	    vision cone. The range and angle of the cone can be easily tweaked in the unity inspector to more quickly find what feels right for the game. Once the enemy detects a player, it "engages" the player character.
	    It takes shots when it has line of sight, and moves to the waypoint closest to where the player was last seen if it does not have a shot. If the player is out of sight for a long enough time, the enemy returns
	    to its default patrol state.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Preperation for the First Playable</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">This week we prepared for the <a href = 'FirstPlayable.pdf'>first playable presentation</a>. We created a starting menu with the options to play the game, change the settings and exit the game.
	    The settings option currently doesn't do anything. We prepared two levels for the player to move in. The first consisted of a room with an enemy and weapon drops. The second room had the layout for one of 
	    our puzzles; however we didn't finish implementing it in time for the presentation. We added health and weapon persistance to the game. When moving between rooms, the player's health, current weapons and ammo
	    count are consistant between levels. Projectiles now deal damage to the player and enemies. At the moment, the amount of damage is hard coded but we plan to change that in the near future. Once the player or
	    enemy run out of health, they despawn. We encountered some issues with the ai character not spotting the player which will need to be fixed. </p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Player Weapons & Controls</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">This week more progress was made on the player character. One of our plans was to create sections in space that utilized weapon momentum. We added a friction coefficient
          which increases the amount of time for the player to stop moving. In addition, it lowers the influence of the players movement controls. The weapon recoil is not affected by this which
          allows the player to move by firing in the opposite direction.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Player Weapons & Controls (continued)</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">We also added a second weapon type. The shotgun fires three projectiles. One directly ahead and one on either side at a 10 degree angle. The shotgun fires slower and has a larger recoil
      than the pistol.We also added the ability to switch between the pistol and shotgun using the space bar.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">Finally, we added some controller support. This has been tested with a wired xbox 360 controller The player is moved using the left analogue stick. When the player tilts the right analogue
      stick, the player character fires in the direction that the stick was tilted in. Currently, weapons can be switched using the a button. When controller input is detected, the mouse cursor
      becomes hidden. Moving with the arrow keys or clicking the mouse button brings it back.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Tiles & Map Building</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">This week we acquired some free assets to work as the current wall and floor sprites. We used Unityâ€™s Tilemap feature to quickly prototype different level layouts by using the Tilemap brushes. This allowed us to easily add collision detections to the walls as well. We will next begin work on creating other types of objects to be placed in our levels. Weapon upgrades will likely be implemented next.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Setup & Player Mechanics</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">We created a unity project and activated the collaboration option so all group members could work together. We created a prototype to test basic player controls. The "player character" can move with wasd and a cursor is generated to show where the player is aiming. The player can shoot by pressing the mouse button or holding the button down. A restriction has been placed on the weapons fire rate. There still isnt any collision detection.</p>
